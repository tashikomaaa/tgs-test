# tgs-test

Thank's for review this technical test.

before start to review it this is my personnal review.

- for the skillvalue test i've got a little 9/20.

for the build test this is my appreciation of my job, and some commentary of it:

- Just got some troubles with the api, don't really know if it's the key are the way i call it.

- I've build a skelton of sails api ( don't realy masterize this lib so i've learn about, and it's take me a lot of time).
For the front i done a refactoring of all the project because my sails api doesn't work at the time, but i want to show something.

- For the Redoc same process, 
need to learn about, take long time, 
and at the final can't implement it in the project at the time.

in global i think i've lost a lot of time to try to understand quickly all the lib at the same time,
note for my next time try to learn one by one.

thank's for this good "d√©fis", hope you enjoy it to review like i enjoy it to do.

keep in touch.
