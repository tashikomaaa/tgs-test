# tgs-test


Just got some troubles with the api, don't really know if it's the key are the way i call it.

But i got all the time an 403.

I've build a skelton of sails api ( don't realy masterize this lib so i've learn about, and it's take me a lot of time).
For the front i done a refactoring of all the project because my sails api doesn't work at the time, but i want to show something.

For the Redoc same process, need to learn about, take long time, and at the final can't implement it in the project at the time.
